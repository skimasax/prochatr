<h1 style="background: #1b4cbc2e; padding: 4px;">Fair Usage Policy</h1>
<p>Prochatr&rsquo;s fair usage policy (&ldquo;FUP&rdquo;) is designed to prevent fraud and abuse of our products. Prochatr&rsquo;s products are for individual use only in accordance with the Agreement and this FUP (&ldquo;Legitimate Use&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The following is a non-exhaustive list of practices that would not be considered Legitimate Use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using subscriptions for telemarketing or call centre operations;</li>
<li>Re-selling subscription minutes;</li>
<li>Sharing subscriptions between users whether via a PBX, call centre, computer or any other means;</li>
<li>Calling numbers (whether singly, sequentially or automatically) to generate income for yourself or others as a result of placing the call, other than for your individual business communications: and</li>
<li>Unusual calling patterns inconsistent with normal, individual subscription use, for example, regular calls of short duration or calls to multiple numbers in a short period of time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other practices may be relevant in determining Legitimate Use and Prochatr reserves the right to take any unlawful, prohibited, abnormal or unusual activity into account in making its determination. Prochatr may at its option, terminate or suspend its relationship with you, and your use of any Prochatr product immediately if it determines you are using the product contrary to this FUP.</p>
<h3>Subscriptions</h3>
<p>Subject to this FUP, Prochatr&rsquo;s unlimited subscriptions allow unlimited calls to landlines in the applicable subscription countries (excluding special, premium, service and non-geographic numbers) for the time period specified at the time of purchase. Unlimited calls to mobiles may also be included where stated at the time of purchase. All calls will be disconnected and require a re-dial after a 4-hour duration.</p>
<h3>Group Video Calling</h3>
<p>Group video calls are subject to a fair usage limit of 100 hours per month with no more than 10 hours per day and a limit of 4 hours per individual video call. Once these limits have been reached, the video will switch off and the call will convert to an audio call. If a participant of a group video call is not on a version of Internet Communications Software that supports group video calls, then the call will be an audio call only for that participant. The number of permitted participants on a group video call varies from 3 to a maximum of 10, depending upon device and associated system requirements.

<p>All calls will be disconnected and require a re-dial after a 4-hour duration and an additional connection fee will be charged on re-dial.</p>
<h3>SMS</h3>
<p>Each SMS message has a limit of 160 characters. If you type a longer message it will be broken down into several SMS messages and you will be charged for each message sent. If you send SMS messages to more than one person you will be charged for each SMS sent to each recipient. If Prochatr cannot (for whatever reason) send your SMS, Prochatr will continue to try to send the message for up to 24 hours after which time the SMS charge will be refunded to your Prochatr Credit balance automatically if delivery is unsuccessful.</p>
<h3>Video Messages</h3>
